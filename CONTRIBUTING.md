# Contributing to PyBaMM

If you'd like to contribute to PyBaMM (thanks!), please have a look at the [guidelines below](#workflow).

If you're already familiar with our workflow, maybe have a quick look at the [pre-commit checks](#pre-commit-checks) directly below.

## Pre-commit checks

Before you commit any code, please perform the following checks:

- [No style issues](#coding-style-guidelines): `$ flake8`
- [All tests pass](#testing): `$ python run-tests.py --unit`
- [The documentation builds](#building-the-documentation): `$ cd docs` and then `$ make clean; make html`

You can even run all three at once, using `$ python run-tests.py --quick`.


## Workflow

We use [GIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) and [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) to coordinate our work. When making any kind of update, we try to follow the procedure below.

### A. Before you begin

1. Create an [issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) where new proposals can be discussed before any coding is done.
2. Create a [branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) of this repo (ideally on your own [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)), where all changes will be made
3. Download the source code onto your local system, by [cloning](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the repository (or your fork of the repository).
4. [Install](#installation) PyBaMM with the developer options.
5. [Test](#testing) if your installation worked, using the test script: `$ python run-tests.py --unit`.

You now have everything you need to start making changes!

### B. Writing your code

5. PyBaMM is developed in [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), and makes heavy use of [NumPy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy) (see also [NumPy for MatLab users](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html) and [Python for R users](http://blog.hackerearth.com/how-can-r-users-learn-python-for-data-science)).
6. Make sure to follow our [coding style guidelines](#coding-style-guidelines).
7. Commit your changes to your branch with [useful, descriptive commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/): Remember these are publicly visible and should still make sense a few months ahead in time. While developing, you can keep using the GitHub issue you're working on as a place for discussion. [Refer to your commits](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8910271/how-can-i-reference-a-commit-in-an-issue-comment-on-github) when discussing specific lines of code.
8. If you want to add a dependency on another library, or re-use code you found somewhere else, have a look at [these guidelines](#dependencies-and-reusing-code).

### C. Merging your changes with PyBaMM

9. [Test your code!](#testing)
10. PyBaMM has online documentation at http://pybamm.readthedocs.io/. To make sure any new methods or classes you added show up there, please read the [documentation](#documentation) section.
11. If you added a major new feature, perhaps it should be showcased in an [example notebook](#example-notebooks).
12. When you feel your code is finished, or at least warrants serious discussion, run the [pre-commit checks](#pre-commit-checks) and then create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) (PR) on [PyBaMM's GitHub page](https://github.com/tinosulzer/pybamm).
13. Once a PR has been created, it will be reviewed by any member of the community. Changes might be suggested which you can make by simply adding new commits to the branch. When everything's finished, someone with the right GitHub permissions will merge your changes into PyBaMM master repository.

Finally, if you really, really, _really_ love developing PyBaMM, have a look at the current [project infrastructure](#infrastructure).


## Installation

To install PyBaMM with all developer options, use:

```
$ pip install -e .[dev,docs]
```

This will

1. Install all the dependencies for PyBaMM, including the ones for documentation (docs) and development (dev).
2. Tell Python to use your local pybamm files when you use `import pybamm` anywhere on your system.

## Coding style guidelines

PyBaMM follows the [PEP8 recommendations](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for coding style. These are very common guidelines, and community tools have been developed to check how well projects implement them.

### Flake8

We use [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) to check our PEP8 adherence. To try this on your system, navigate to the PyBaMM directory in a console and type

```
$ flake8
```
The configuration file
```
.flake8
```
allows us to ignore some errors. If you think this should be added or removed, please submit an [issue](#issues)

When you commit your changes they will be checked against flake8 automatically (see [infrastructure](#infrastructure)).


### Black

We use [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to automatically configure our code to adhere to PEP8. Black can be used in two ways:

1. Command line: navigate to the PyBaMM directory in a console and type
```
$ black {source_file_or_directory}
```
2. Editor: black can be [configured](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/editor_integration.html) to automatically reformat a python script each time the script is saved in an editor.

By default, black sets the max line length to 88. To change this to the more common standard of 79, and you are using black from the command line, save the following to a file called `pyproject.toml`:
```
[tool.black]
line-length = 79
```
This file is ignored by git as it breaks Travis CI during installation at the line `pip install .`.

If you want to use black in your editor, you may need to change the max line length in your editor settings.

Even when code has been formatted by black, you should still make sure that it adheres to the PEP8 standard set by [Flake8](#flake8).

### Naming

Naming is hard. In general, we aim for descriptive class, method, and argument names. Avoid abbreviations when possible without making names overly long, so `mean` is better than `mu`, but a class name like `MyClass` is fine.

Class names are CamelCase, and start with an upper case letter, for example `MyOtherClass`. Method and variable names are lower case, and use underscores for word separation, for example `x` or `iteration_count`.

### Python 2 and 3

Python is currently in a long, long transition phase from Python 2 to Python 3. PyBaMM supports both Python 2 (version 2.7 and upwards) and Python 3 (version 3.4 and upwards).
The easiest way to write code that works on both versions is to write for Python 3, (avoiding the more spectacular new features) and [then test on both versions](#testing).

In addition, most scripts start with these lines:

```
from __future__ import absolute_import, division
from __future__ import print_function, unicode_literals
```

These [future imports](https://docs.python.org/2/library/__future__.html) are ignored by Python 3, but tell Python 2 to mimmick some of its features. Notably, the ``division`` package changes the result of ``3 / 2`` from ``1`` to ``1.5`` (this means you can write ``1 / x`` instead of ``1.0 / x``).


## Dependencies and reusing code

While it's a bad idea for developers to "reinvent the wheel", it's important for users to get a _reasonably sized download and an easy install_. In addition, external libraries can sometimes cease to be supported, and when they contain bugs it might take a while before fixes become available as automatic downloads to PyBaMM users.
For these reasons, all dependencies in PyBaMM should be thought about carefully, and discussed on GitHub.

Direct inclusion of code from other packages is possible, as long as their license permits it and is compatible with ours, but again should be considered carefully and discussed in the group. Snippets from blogs and [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) can often be included without attribution, but if they solve a particularly nasty problem (or are very hard to read) it's often a good idea to attribute (and document) them, by making a comment with a link in the source code.

### Separating dependencies

On the other hand... We _do_ want to compare several tools, to generate documentation, and to speed up development. For this reason, the dependency structure is split into 4 parts:

1. Core PyBaMM: A minimal set, including things like NumPy, SciPy, etc. All infrastructure should run against this set of dependencies, as well as any numerical methods we implement ourselves.
2. Extras: Other inference packages and their dependencies. Methods we don't want to implement ourselves, but do want to provide an interface to can have their dependencies added here.
3. Documentation generating code: Everything you need to generate and work on the docs.
4. Development code: Everything you need to do PyBaMM development (so all of the above packages, plus flake8 and other testing tools).

Only 'core pybamm' is installed by default. The others have to be specified explicitly when running the installation command.

### Matplotlib

We use Matplotlib in PyBaMM, but with two caveats:

First, Matplotlib should only be used in plotting methods, and these should _never_ be called by other PyBaMM methods. So users who don't like Matplotlib will not be forced to use it in any way. Use in notebooks is OK and encouraged.

Second, Matplotlib should never be imported at the module level, but always inside methods. For example:

```
def plot_great_things(self, x, y, z):
    import matplotlib.pyplot as pl
    ...
```

This allows people to (1) use PyBaMM without ever importing Matplotlib and (2) configure Matplotlib's back-end in their scripts, which _must_ be done before e.g. `pyplot` is first imported.


## Testing

All code requires testing. We use the [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/unittest.html) package for our tests. (These tests typically just check that the code runs without error, and so, are more _debugging_ than _testing_ in a strict sense. Nevertheless, they are very useful to have!)

To run quick tests, use

```
$ python run-tests.py --unit
```

### Writing tests

Every new feature should have its own test. To create ones, have a look at the `test` directory and see if there's a test for a similar method. Copy-pasting this is a good way to start.

Next, add some simple (and speedy!) tests of your main features. If these run without exceptions that's a good start! Next, check the output of your methods using any of these [assert methods](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/unittest.html#assert-methods).

### Running more tests

If you want to check your tests on Python 2 and 3, use

```
$ python run-tests.py --unit2 --unit3
```

When you commit anything to PyBaMM, these checks will also be run automatically (see [infrastructure](#infrastructure)).

### Testing notebooks

To test all example notebooks, use

```
$ python run-tests.py --books
```

If notebooks fail because of changes to pybamm, it can be a bit of a hassle to debug. In these cases, you can create a temporary export of a notebook's Python content using

```
$ python run-tests.py --debook examples/notebooks/notebook-name.ipynb script.py
```


## Documentation

PyBaMM is documented in several ways.

First and foremost, every method and every class should have a [docstring](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) that describes in plain terms what it does, and what the expected input and output is.

These docstrings can be fairly simple, but can also make use of [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html), a markup language designed specifically for writing [technical documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText). For example, you can link to other classes and methods by writing ```:class:`pybamm.Model` ``` and  ```:meth:`run()` ```.

In addition, we write a (very) small bit of documentation in separate reStructuredText files in the `docs` directory. Most of what these files do is simply import docstrings from the source code. But they also do things like add tables and indexes. If you've added a new class to a module, search the `docs` directory for that module's `.rst` file and add your class (in alphabetical order) to its index. If you've added a whole new module, copy-paste another module's file and add a link to your new file in the appropriate `index.rst` file.

Using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) the documentation in `docs` can be converted to HTML, PDF, and other formats. In particular, we use it to generate the documentation on http://pybamm.readthedocs.io/

### Building the documentation

To test and debug the documentation, it's best to build it locally. To do this, make sure you have the relevant dependencies installed (see [installation](#installation)), navigate to your PyBaMM directory in a console, and then type:

```
cd docs
make clean
make html
```

Next, open a browser, and navigate to your local PyBaMM directory (by typing the path, or part of the path into your location bar). Then have a look at `<your pybamm path>/docs/build/html/index.html`.


### Example notebooks

Major PyBaMM features are showcased in [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) stored in the [examples directory](examples/notebooks). Which features are "major" is of course wholly subjective, so please discuss on GitHub first!

All example notebooks should be listed in [examples/README.md](https://github.com/tinosulzer/pybamm/examples/notebooks/README.md). Please follow the (naming and writing) style of existing notebooks where possible.

Where possible, notebooks are tested daily. A list of slow notebooks (which time-out and fail tests) is maintained in `.slow-books`, these notebooks will be excluded from daily testing.


## Infrastructure

### Setuptools

Installation of PyBaMM _and dependencies_ is handled via [setuptools](http://setuptools.readthedocs.io/)

Configuration files:

```
setup.py
```

Note that this file must be kept in sync with

- The version number in [pybamm/__init__.py](pybamm/__init__.py).
- The dependencies and dependency structure of the [pip requirements files](#pip).

### PIP

Installation of PyBaMM dependencies can also be handled by [PIP](http://pip.readthedocs.io/). This is needed for certain other tools too.

Configuration files ([format](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/1.1/requirements.html)):

```
requirements.txt
requirements-dev.txt
requirements-docs.txt
```

Note that these files must be kept in sync with

- The dependencies and dependency structure of setuptools `setup.py`.

The requirements files link to each other, so that calling `$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` will install everything listed in `requirements.txt` and `requirements-docs.txt` as well.

It's always worth using an up-to-date version of pip. On older systems especially, having an up-to-date pip will prevent all kinds of version incompatibility issues:

```
$ pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Travis CI

All committed code is tested using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), tests are published on https://travis-ci.org/tinosulzer/pybamm.

Configuration files:

```
.travis.yaml
```

Unit tests and flake8 testing is done for every commit. A nightly cronjob also tests the notebooks. Notebooks listed in `.slow-books` are excluded from these tests.

<!-- ### Appveyor

 -->


### Codecov

Code coverage (how much of our code is actually seen by the (linux) unit tests) is tested using [Codecov](https://docs.codecov.io/), a report is visible on https://codecov.io/gh/tinosulzer/pybamm.

Configuration files:

```
.coveragerc
```

### Read the Docs

Documentation is built using https://readthedocs.org/ and published on http://pybamm.readthedocs.io/.

### Binder

Editable notebooks are made available using [Binder](mybinder.readthedocs.io) at https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tinosulzer/PyBaMM/master.

Configuration files:

```
postBuild
```

### GitHub

GitHub does some magic with particular filenames. In particular:

- The first page people see when they go to [our GitHub page](https://github.com/tinosulzer/PyBaMM) displays the contents of [README.md](README.md), which is written in the [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) format. Some guidelines can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-readmes/).
- The license for using PyBaMM is stored in [LICENSE](LICENSE), and [automatically](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository/) linked to by GitHub.
- This file, [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) is recognised as the contribution guidelines and a link is [automatically](https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-guidelines) displayed when new issues or pull requests are created.
